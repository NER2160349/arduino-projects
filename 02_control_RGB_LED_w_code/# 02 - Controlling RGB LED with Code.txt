# 02 - Controlling RGB LED with Code

# Description
This Arduino project controls an RGB LED using code in the Arduino IDE. It demonstrates how to mix colors by adjusting the brightness of the red, green, and blue channels.

# Circuit
- Common cathode RGB LED
- Red → Pin ~6 (via 220Ω resistor)
- Green → Pin ~5 (via 220Ω resistor)
- Blue → Pin ~3 (via 220Ω resistor)
- All resistors connected in series with the LED channels
- Common cathode connected to GND

# What I Learned
- How to use `analogWrite()` to control LED brightness with PWM
- Mapping RGB values to create custom colors
- Practiced C++ logic in Arduino
