# 03 - Using Digital Inputs to Control LEDs

# Description
This project has two parts:

1. A basic on/off button to control an LED.

2. An extension with four buttons, each controlling the LED brightness at different levels — high, medium, low, and off. This project builds on the concepts learned in Project 02.

# Circuit
- Green LED connected through a 220 Ω resistor to pin ~5 (PWM-enabled pin).

Four buttons connected to digital input pins, each corresponding to a brightness level: High (255), Medium (110), Low (50), Off (0).

# What I Learned
- How to use INPUT_PULLUP mode for buttons and how it changes the logic in conditions.
- How to extend previous code by adding multiple inputs with different functionalities.
- Better understanding of the difference between analogWrite() and digitalWrite() functions.
