# 06 - Controlling Servos with Uno & Code

# Description
This project has three parts:

1. Servo Sweep – Sweeps the servo from 0° to 180° with a 1s delay.

2. Servo Degrees – Moves the servo to specific angles: 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, each with a 1s delay.

3. Servo + LED Degrees – Adds an LED that blinks each time the servo moves to a new angle.

# Circuit
- Servo: GND, 5V, signal to ~9 (PWM pin).
- LED (Part 3): Long leg to pin 13 through 220Ω resistor, short leg to GND.
Servo GND is routed through the breadboard and connected to Arduino GND using a jumper wire.

# What I Learned
- How to control servo motion through code.
- How to integrate LED behavior with servo logic.
