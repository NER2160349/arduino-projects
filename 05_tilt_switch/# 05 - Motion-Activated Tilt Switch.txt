# 05 - Motion-Activated Tilt Switch Uno Alarm

# Description
This project combines what I learned with the active buzzer, LED control, and introduces a tilt switch to simulate a theft alarm for my Elegoo.
# Circuit
- Tilt switch: GND and digital pin ~10
- Active buzzer: GND and  digital pin ~9
- LED: GND → 220Ω resistor → pin 8

# What I Learned
- How to combine previous lessons
- How a tilt switch detects movement
- How to connect and control all three components simultaneously
