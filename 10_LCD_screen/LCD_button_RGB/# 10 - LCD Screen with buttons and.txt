# 10 - LCD Screen with buttons and RGB LED

# Description
This project uses an LCD screen to display outputs based on button inputs, which also control an RGB LED.

# Circuit
- LCD Screen:
 * RS pin to digital pin 7
 * Enable pin to digital pin 8
 * D4 pin to digital pin 9
 * D5 pin to digital pin 10
 * D6 pin to digital pin 11
 * D7 pin to digital pin 12
 * R/W pin to GND
 * VSS pin to GND
 * VCC pin to 5V
 * VO (pin 3) → middle of a 10K potentiometer, with the other ends connected to GND and 5V

- Buttons: Each button is connected between GND and digital pins 2, 3, 4, 5, and 13.

- RGB LED: 
* Red → pin 6 via 220Ω resistor
* Green → A1 via 220Ω resistor
* Blue → A2 via 220Ω resistor
* Common cathode (longest leg) → GND
