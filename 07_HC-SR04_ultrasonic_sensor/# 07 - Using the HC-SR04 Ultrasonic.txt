# 07 - Using the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor

# Description
This project has two parts:

1. Ultrasonic basics – Reads and outputs distance data from the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to the Serial Monitor. The closer the object is to the sensor, the smaller the distance value displayed.

2. Ultrasonic with RGB LED – Builds on the first part by integrating an RGB LED. The LED changes color based on the distance of an object detected by the sensor.

# Circuit
- Ultrasonic sensor:
 VCC → 5V, GND → GND, Trig → Pin ~11, Echo → Pin 12.

- RGB LED: Red → Pin ~6, Green → Pin ~9, Blue → Pin ~10, Each color pin is connected through a 220Ω resistor to ground.

# What I Learned
- How to read and interpret distance data using an ultrasonic sensor.
- How to control an RGB LED and change its color based on sensor input.
- How to integrate sensors and outputs to create responsive interactions.
