# 09 - IR Remote and Sensor with LCD screen

# Description
This project combines an IR remote and sensor with an LCD screen to display the button pressed. I started with the basic functionality of decoding IR signals and outputting them to the Serial Monitor. Then, I extended the project by integrating an LCD display to show the button labels visually—combining two previously learned concepts into one.


# Circuit
- IR Receiver: 
* Signal pin connected to digital pin 6 on the Arduino
* Connected to 5V and GND
- Red LED
* Connected to digital pin 13
- LCD (16x2)
* RS → pin 7
* EN → pin 8
* D4 → pin 9
* D5 → pin 10
* D6 → pin 11
* D7 → pin 12
* VSS and RW → GND
* VCC → 5V
* VO (contrast) → middle pin of a potentiometer
* Potentiometer ends connected to 5V and GND

All components share a common ground and 5V power rail from the Arduino.

# What I Learned
- How to decode IR signals using a switch-case structure.
- How to adapt serial output logic to display readable messages on an LCD screen.
- How to combine two subsystems (IR and LCD) into one cohesive project.
